At the time of writing, translation review can only be performed for a language by users who are reviewers for that language. The language team coordinators for the language decide which users will be reviewers for the language.

## Requesting Review Privileges

You can request to be a reviewer using the `Contact Team Coordinators` button on the language page.

This lets you send a message to the coordinators for the language team, in which you can write a message asking to become a reviewer.

## Adding Reviewers (for language team coordinators)

If you are a language team coordinator and you want to make someone a reviewer, navigate to the page for your language team, locate the user in the users table, and check the `Reviewer` checkbox.

You should see a message at the top of the page when you have made someone a reviewer.
