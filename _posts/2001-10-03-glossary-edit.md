Glossaries can be edited by users with roles *glossarist* or *glossary-admin*.
For more information on these roles, see [Glossary Roles and Permissions]({{ site.url }}/help/glossary/glossary-roles-permissions).


To edit a glossary entry you must be signed in to Zanata and open the
translation editor in the language you wish to edit. Instructions for opening
the translation editor can be found at [Preparing for Translation]({{ site.url }}/help/translation/preparing-for-translation).

1. Ensure the glossary panel is open. The glossary panel is located at the
bottom right of the editor. If the glossary panel is not visible, either open
the bottom panel, or open the editor options panel and check "Show Glossary
Suggestions".
1. Perform a search for the term you wish to edit. To search for a term, either
select a row in the main editor window that includes the term, or enter the term
in the glossary search textbox.
